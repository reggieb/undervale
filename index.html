        <h3>Code should be easy to read.</h3>
        <p>
          You should not need to know the coding language to be able to
          understand what the code is doing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Readable code is easier to maintain, because it is easier to determine
          what each section is doing and therefore identify quickly what needs
          to be modified. Also it is then easier to make that modification because
          time is not wasted trying to work out how the code is working.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rigour required to craft readable code tends to lead to the
          development of robust systems, because the process focuses the mind
          on understanding what each element of code is doing.

        <h3>Good performance is vital to a good user experience</h3>
        <p>
          An application that does not respond as quickly and reliably as
          users expect, will not continue to be used. And an application that
          is not used, is of no use to anyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Out and out speed rarely corresponds to good performance, as it
          tends towards making shortcuts which sacrifice readability. Thereby,
          they make the code harder to maintain, and bugs become harder to fix.
          A method that returns the wrong answer in 1 milliseconds is never
          as good as the method that returns the right answer in 2 milliseconds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Keeping things simple, using and understanding the best techniques,
          and staying abreast of technology developments, all help in
          achieving good performance. Clean simple code tends to lead to good
          performance and therefore should always be the starting point.
        </p>

      <section id="testing" class="step" data-x="0" data-y="2500" data-rotate="-300" data-scale="3">
        <h3>Testing and refactoring</h3>
        <p>
          Refactoring is key to ensuring that code is continually improved and 
          that the introduction or removal of elements does not adversely effect 
          the rest of the application. Without refactoring, code does not get
          better each time it is worked on. In fact, the opposite happens.
          Code that is not refactored as it is developed becomes confused and
          difficult to maintain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without a good test suite, refactoring becomes difficult as an
          application grows. If a developer knows they can rely on their tests to
          identify the adverse effects of any change, they are able to make changes
          and know the scope of that change. Thereby, they can make the
          modifications needed to successfully accommodate the refactor.
        <p>
          <em>
            Refactoring is essential to the development of good code, and
            therefore, developing a good suite of tests is also essential.
          </em>
